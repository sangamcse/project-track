- Tested [coala-bears](https://github.com/coala-bears) repo using the _`LocalBearTestHelper`_ changes and new virtual environment. The collected test items were not good.
- As the previous changes were breaking the coala-bears repo, reverted the _`LocalBearTestHelper`_ class code and inherited _`BaseTestHelper`_ and _`unittest.TestCase`_ class.
- Opened PR for _`GlobalBearTestHelper`_: [coala#5522](https://github.com/coala/coala/pull/5522)
- 4<sup>th</sup> hangouts meet.
